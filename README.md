# ascii-art-with-python
<h1>hi guys! Thanks for visiting this repository. Here, I made an ascii-art of the picture of TOM Hanks. It means I changed the picture to an ascii-art thing. To see this, go to the file named <strong>tom.txt</strong>. Then, compare it with the main picture(tom.png). It is quite similar!
  I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/">pywhakit</a> for this.</h1>
